<!--Tropical Cyclone Forecast Positions-->
The tropical cyclone over the seas east of the Philippines will move across the Philippines in the latter part of this week and enter the northeastern part of the South China Sea, and then move towards the vicinity of the Luzon Strait.<pre>

<!--/Tropical Cyclone Past Positions-->
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>1. The potential track areas, based on average errors, of the latest analysed position 
and 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120-hour forecast positions are of the order of 30, 125, 225, 325, 400 and 500 
kilometres respectively. <br>
<br>
2. When Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 or above is in force, the tropical cyclone 
track, analysed positions and maximum sustained wind near centre are updated every hour. 
Meanwhile, the webpage will also display other information, including distance and bearing 
of the tropical cyclone relative to Hong Kong, and forecast moving direction and speed. <br>
<br>
3. When the tropical cyclone is within the area bounded by 10-30N and 105-125E, the tropical 
cyclone track, analysed positions and maximum sustained wind near centre are updated 
eight times a day at 0:30, 3:30, 6:30, 9:30, 12:30, 15:30, 18:30 and 21:30 HKT, about one and 
a half hours after the time of observation. Meanwhile, the webpage will also display other 
information, including distance and bearing of the tropical cyclone relative to Hong Kong. <br>
<br>
4. Within the area bounded by 7-36N and 100-140E but outside the area bounded by 10-30N and 
105-125E, when there is an area of low pressure intensified into a tropical cyclone or a 
tropical cyclone has entered this area, the Observatory will issue the information of 
tropical cyclone track, analysed positions and maximum sustained wind near centre within two hours. 
The positions at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00 and 20:00 HKT and 72-hour forecast tracks will be updated 
four times a day at around 04:00, 10:00, 16:00 and 22:00 HKT respectively. <br>
<br>
5. The past tropical cyclone track and analysed positions and maximum sustained wind near centre 
may be updated when additional data is received. <br>
<br>
6. Short-term erratic departures of the tropical cyclone from the general direction 
of movement may occur from time to time. These departures are partly due to uncertainties 
in locating the centre of the tropical cyclone, and partly due to actual short-term 
variations in the direction and speed of movement of the tropical cyclone itself. </p>
